# README for viewer.py module

## Overview
This web application provides an interface for users to search and view the data collected using `scraper` module.
The application is built using Flask and provides a user-friendly interface for data exploration and analysis.

## Web Interface

The web interface consists of the following pages:

### Home Page

The home page provides an overview of the dataset and allows users to explore the data.

By clicking the `Explore Data` button, users can view the aggregated data and statistical profiling of the dataset.

### Programs Page 

The programs page allows users to filter the dataset by program and access the relevant reports.

A program search form with autocomplete is provided for users to filter samples by program. Upon entering a URL and clicking the `Fetch` button, the website generates and display a report.

A button `Show/Hide Snapshots` allows users to toggle the visibility of 
  a table displaying URL time snapshots.
