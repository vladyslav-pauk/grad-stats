  I need a Python function that extracts all unique PhD student names from an HTML source.
  Extracted name should contain only letters, spaces, and hyphens.
  The function signature should be `extract_phd_student_names(source: BeautifulSoup) -> list[str]`.
  Analyze the following HTML source chunks to understand the structure of the web page.
  Based on specific structure and patterns, provide the function and necessary import statements.

  {html_chunks}

update_function_prompt: |
    Update the function based on the patterns in HTML source below.
    You can't use filtering of an existing list, instead use matching patterns and HTML structures.
    
    In your response, provide only the code with the function and necessary import statements are included.
    The function signature should be `extract_phd_student_names(source: BeautifulSoup) -> list[str]`.
  
    Find below results of running a function.
  
    Function:
    ```python
    {function_code}
    ```
    
    Extracted names:
    {names}
  
    Error message:
    {error_message}
    
    HTML source code:
    {html_chunks}

  
validate_names_prompt: |
  Only if every single item is a valid person name containing only letters, spaces, and hyphens, return only one string “all items are valid names” and nothing else.
  Only otherwise, provide updated function that extracts only valid names from any html source.
  Make sure the format of the resulting names is correct, i.e. letters, spaces, and hyphens only, and no newlines or extra spaces, commas and special characters.
  
  {names}
